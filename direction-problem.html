          <p>Developing a search technique (strategy) when you know a possible position of your
target, and keep on updating your prior information, with respect to your initial point and your
target’s possible location using some Bayesian approach, and then further calculating the accuracy
of the process. We tried to present the problem in form of a story so that readers don’t find it that
            boring to leave it untouched.</p>
          
          <h3>So what’s the Problem???</h3>
          
            <p>A man seeking a job is going for an interview but he has no idea of the city, he only knows the
  geographic direction (East, West, North, and South etc.) and he also knows that his office is located
  in the North-west direction from the bus stop. He was instructed to get off at the bus stand and ask
  anyone to instruct him further. After getting off at the city bus stand he meets a person and asks him
  how to get to the office, he says, "Go ahead!! You will find a diversion of four identical roads. There
  is a beggar sitting in front of one of the four diversions, take that diversion and you will meet an
              ice-cream seller who will lead you to your destination."</p>
          
          <p>But unfortunately, the beggar that day sat in front of a different road (any of the other three roads,
other than the one the person intended). The stranger following the given instructions takes the
road where he found the beggar sitting. Hence he might find either a candy seller, a fruit seller or a
newspaper vendor, but not the ice cream seller. Meeting someone other than the ice cream van will
make him realise that he is going in the wrong direction, so he stops and again explains the situation
the one whom he meet, but the ice cream vendor, candy seller, fruit seller or the newspaper man do
not know each other, so he will ask the possible geographic direction of his destination, without
taking the risk of being misled further. If he knows that he walked towards north before taking one
of the diversions and after that he took a right turn and then a left turn to meet newspaper vendor
(say). Now using the information he gets from the persons he meets and his sense of direction, he
develops a strategy to reach his destination by finding out an optimal path following which he will
never be late (assuming that no one misdirects him intentionally). So what can be his strategy and
            how often do you think his strategy may work?</p>
          
          <h3>Let’s think together, what you would have done in such a situation, when you have no smartphone
            (just for the sake of solving the problem)?</h3>
          
          <p>Although our friend is still jobless (may be consequences of unemployment), he is quite smart with
some knowledge of mathematics and probability). Once misled, he decides not to be misdirected
again and loose some important time so he starts asking the geographic direction (East, West, North,
and South etc.). He took out a piece of paper and first drew the axes of direction on a corner of that
and drew a special kind of rectangle( such that more or less 60% of the rectangle always happens to
be a square) keeping his possible direction well inside that rectangle and keeping himself as any
corner or vertex of that rectangle. In this case as he knows that he was facing north before taking
one of the diversions and after taking the diversion ( where he found the deaf beggar sitting), he
turned right and then left to meet the newspaper vendor, it’s evident that now he is facing towards
north and his destination is towards north-west (leftward). So in his rectangle he will be at thebottom right corner or vertex, his destination is somewhere in the area enclosed by the two
            opposite adjacent sides from the bottom right corner.</p>
