          <p>Developing a search technique (strategy) when you know a possible position of your
target, and keep on updating your prior information, with respect to your initial point and your
target’s possible location using some Bayesian approach, and then further calculating the accuracy
of the process. We tried to present the problem in form of a story so that readers don’t find it that
            boring to leave it untouched.</p>
          
          <h3>So what’s the Problem???</h3>
          
            <p>A man seeking a job is going for an interview but he has no idea of the city, he only knows the
  geographic direction (East, West, North, and South etc.) and he also knows that his office is located
  in the North-west direction from the bus stop. He was instructed to get off at the bus stand and ask
  anyone to instruct him further. After getting off at the city bus stand he meets a person and asks him
  how to get to the office, he says, "Go ahead!! You will find a diversion of four identical roads. There
  is a beggar sitting in front of one of the four diversions, take that diversion and you will meet an
              ice-cream seller who will lead you to your destination."</p>
          
          <p>But unfortunately, the beggar that day sat in front of a different road (any of the other three roads,
other than the one the person intended). The stranger following the given instructions takes the
road where he found the beggar sitting. Hence he might find either a candy seller, a fruit seller or a
newspaper vendor, but not the ice cream seller. Meeting someone other than the ice cream van will
make him realise that he is going in the wrong direction, so he stops and again explains the situation
the one whom he meet, but the ice cream vendor, candy seller, fruit seller or the newspaper man do
not know each other, so he will ask the possible geographic direction of his destination, without
taking the risk of being misled further. If he knows that he walked towards north before taking one
of the diversions and after that he took a right turn and then a left turn to meet newspaper vendor
(say). Now using the information he gets from the persons he meets and his sense of direction, he
develops a strategy to reach his destination by finding out an optimal path following which he will
never be late (assuming that no one misdirects him intentionally). So what can be his strategy and
            how often do you think his strategy may work?</p>
          
          <h3>Let’s think together, what you would have done in such a situation, when you have no smartphone
            (just for the sake of solving the problem)?</h3>
          
          <p>Although our friend is still jobless (may be consequences of unemployment), he is quite smart with
some knowledge of mathematics and probability). Once misled, he decides not to be misdirected
again and loose some important time so he starts asking the geographic direction (East, West, North,
and South etc.). He took out a piece of paper and first drew the axes of direction on a corner of that
and drew a special kind of rectangle( such that more or less 60% of the rectangle always happens to
be a square) keeping his possible direction well inside that rectangle and keeping himself as any
corner or vertex of that rectangle. In this case as he knows that he was facing north before taking
one of the diversions and after taking the diversion ( where he found the deaf beggar sitting), he
turned right and then left to meet the newspaper vendor, it’s evident that now he is facing towards
north and his destination is towards north-west (leftward). So in his rectangle he will be at thebottom right corner or vertex, his destination is somewhere in the area enclosed by the two
            opposite adjacent sides from the bottom right corner.</p>
          
          <center><img src="https://github.com/Srijit641/Pictures/raw/master/direction-problem-1.png"></center>
          
          <p>Above here, is the axes of direction as he drawn on his paper and in the adjacent figure, he denotes
his present position as p<sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup> (the bottom left vertex of the rectangle) and his possible destination as <b>D</b>.</p>
          
          <p>Now he asks a person whom he meets two questions, as follows-<br>
Q1. In which direction is his destination?<br>
            If the answer is say towards left, then the 2<sup>nd</sup> question,<br>
Q2. Is there is nearly 60% chance that my destination is somewhere near me?<br>
            If the answer is <b>“yes”</b> or <b>“can’t say, I’m not a statistician”</b> or even <b>“no”</b>, he proceeds with his further
            strategy.</p>
          
          <p>Now look carefully if he stands facing north then his left means west, but our friend knows that the
location is possibly north-west , so to him left means union of north and north-west ( which still
remains left for our friend), and hence if the person says left our friend is happy to continue, but if
the first answer is not left he should not trust the stranger and ask again to another one, as he is
very much certain that the possible direction of his destination have to be leftward from his position
as he knows the bus stop is now towards his south( as he facing north) and he neither have travelled
            a long distance from the bus stop yet.</p>
          
          <p>Now let’s come to the answer of the second question (Q2), if the answer is “yes” or “can’t say.....”,
he cuts the rectangle one big and one small such that the bigger rectangle (or in this case a square,
due to the special kind of the former rectangle) is at least 60% of the former rectangle and the
smaller rectangle is at most 40% of the former rectangle. Now as he was said that there is 60%
chance that his destination may ( due to answer “yes”) or may not( due to the answer “ can’t say...”)
be anywhere near him, he draws the bigger rectangle is towards right or east ( following the axes he
drawn on the corner of the paper). But still he have some suspect about the information and cannot
take the risk of avoiding the bigger rectangle completely (let’s call it <b>rejection rectangle (square)</b> ),
even though from his current state of information its says there is at least 60% of chance, that his
destination is not anywhere near him. So he decides to cover a part of the rejection square (not the
whole) without taking any paths towards east or south (just to keep himself psychologically near tohis destinations), hence he will cover maximum area that can be covered within the rejection
            rectangle not going towards east or south.</p>
          
          <center><img src="https://github.com/Srijit641/Pictures/raw/master/direction-problem-2.png"></center>
          
          <p>Shown above how he divided the former rectangle into a bigger rectangle or a possible square (60%
of the former rectangle), here the 60% rectangle (or square) is our rejection rectangle (square).<br><br>
Now as he decides to cover the maximum of the rejection rectangle (or square), from p<sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>.<br><br>
There is no value of the answer “no” as an answer to his second question, as he knows that his
destination is somewhere to his left and he is suspecting either of the former answers and covering
the maximum area in the rejection rectangle anyway, so the answer “no” is as good as the other two
answers. Funny enough isn’t it!!<br><br>
            Actually all the answers of the 2<sup>nd</sup> question is equivalent to him, he is just asking it may be for sake
of psychological peace, if he is confident enough about his present position with respect to the bus
stop( starting point) and his possible destination, he may not bother to ask that question either.<br><br>
            So, his path from p<sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup> will be somewhat-</p>
          
          <center><img src="https://github.com/Srijit641/Pictures/raw/master/direction-problem-3.png"></center>
          
          <p>Put r=0 ; the area under the curve is the area our friend is likely to cover before going to the other
half of the rectangle. Note that, our friend may even find a way to his destination (D), even from this
bounded area, but if he fails to find a route from the above bounded area, he will end up being at
            p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, where he will have to again find another person to ask some question.</p>
          
          <p>But before asking, the other passer-by let us explain why our friend drew such a (regular)curve such
that the adjacent sides of the rejection rectangle(square), happens to be tangents to the curve at p<sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>
and p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>. Actually as we said our friend knows a bit of mathematics, so he knows that the above claim
            actually follows from a theorem named <b>Isoperimetric Theorem</b>. The theorem states that “within aclosed isoperimetric (same or constant perimeter) regular figure the maximum possible area that
can be covered has to be a circle.”</p>
          
          <p>Now if our rejection rectangle is actually a square , as stated due the speciality of the rectangle
drawn by our friend at first, then the maximum possible area that can be covered within the square is
            (π/4)r<sup>2</sup> square units , if we consider the sides of the rejection square to be r units. Note that “(π/4)r<sup>2</sup> square units” is the area that can either be covered by a circle within a square of sides r units , or the
same area can be covered also by a quarter of a circle of radius r units. In this case, let us consider
the latter case as it supports our friend’s strategy of “not to travel towards east or south”.</p>
          
          <p>So now, with well satisfied with “why our friend chose such a path”, let’s move on to establish what
should be his strategy from thereafter.<br><br>
            So at p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, he will ask again questions but this time 3 questions, as he almost may have forgotten the
position of the bus stop with respect to his present position (p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>).<br><br>
            Hence the possible questions are,<br><br>
            Q1. What is the direction I’m facing now? And in which direction, I can find the bus stop?<br><br>
            At, point p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, one might say him that he is facing towards west and the city bus stop is towards
south-east (SE), which may make him surprised( as he neither travelled south nor east), so he will
            ask another question to the 2<sup>nd</sup> stranger.<br><br>
            Q2. In which direction is my destination?<br><br>
            If the answer is say towards left, then he feels satisfied with the stranger’s, answer to the
first question. But why?<br>
            Because, he will understand that he is facing west (W) and the direction of the bus stop is in
SE, even though he came a long way towards north-west(NW)(as he didn’t took a single way
towards east or south), but haven’t yet found his destination, this means that he may have
possibly travelled a more towards north(N) than towards west(W). So using the the answers
of both the above questions, he develops his hypothesis about his destination as,
“ my destination is towards left(L) means its towards south(S), but I know it can’t be so, but I
have also travelled more towards N than towards W, which implies that I have tom travel a
bit towards S and W to equalise my excessive movement towards N. my movement should
be towards south-west(SW).<br>
            Hence, SW = L ∪ W, where L ≈ S;<br>
And hence he proceeds to the last and useless question,<br><br>
            Q3. Is there is at least 60% chance that my destination is somewhere near me?<br><br>
            If the answer is <b>“yes”</b> or <b>“can’t say, I’m not a statistician”</b> or even <b>“no”</b>, he proceeds with his further
strategy.<br><br>
            Now his strategy is very similar from here what he did earlier, he now again divides the 40% of the
remaining former rectangle (which he not yet travelled), into two a square and a rectangle. The
square will be the 60% of that rectangle which he haven’t travelled yet. By the information he got at
p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, he constructs the square(60% of the smaller rectangle) towards his right, as he was said that the
possible location of his destination is towards left, and he also decides not to take any more paths
towards north (N) or east(E), as he needs to equalise his excessive movements towards north hemade while covering the 1<sup>st</sup> rejection square. Now again this square becomes his 2<sup>nd</sup> rejection
            square, we he decides to cover the maximum of it like he did in the 1<sup>st</sup> rejection square.<br><br>
            So again his path to in the 2<sup>nd</sup> rejection square is as</p>
          
          <center><img src="https://github.com/Srijit641/Pictures/raw/master/direction-problem-4.png"></center>
          
          <p>the direction axes given is the direction axes at the point p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>.</p>
          
          <p>Similarly, even after performing this for r times he fails to find his destination, his strategy will be the
same,<br><br>
            1. Asking questions and assessing his position with respect to the bus stop (initial point) and his
possible location D.<br>
2. Dividing his suspected rectangle in a 60-40 proportion, such that the 60% of the rectangle
always gives him a rejection square, which he covers with a certain suspect probability, such
that he travels maximum of the rejection square.<br>
3. If he fails to find his way to his destination from the r<sup>th>/sup> rejection square, and comes to the
            point p<sub>r</sub><sup>0</sup>, and he do the same again, until he reaches D.</p>
            
            <p>So, combining above figures and assuming that our friend will reach D after covering 6
              rejection square, then our friend’s path may seem like this-</p>
          
          <center><img src="https://github.com/Srijit641/Pictures/raw/master/direction-problem-5.png"></center>
          
          <p>[In the given figure, the or points where the curve is having tangents are
p<sub>0</sub><sup>0</sup>, p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>, p<sub>2</sub><sup>0</sup>, p<sub>3</sub><sup>0</sup>, p<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup>, p<sub>5</sub><sup>0</sup> and p<sub>6</sub><sup>0</sup> and eventually he will find D. ]</p>
            
            <p>It’s quite surprising isn’t it?<br><br>
              The path in which our friend converges towards D is a <b>Logarithmic Spiral</b>!! and also that he will
              eventually find his destination somewhere in some j<sup>th</sup> rejection square , after meeting and collecting
information from j-1 strangers.<br><br>
              <center><b>“If you know, it’s more likely that something may not be there,
                Then you may often find it there.”</b></center><br><br>
              Well now happy with a strategy in hand, our friend must keep another thing in his mind(or in hand),
which he may fall short off if he doesn’t take care of it from the very beginning of his journey. That
              thing is <b>time</b>.</p>
          
          <p>He must even make a strategy how he should spend his time in each rejection square such that he is
            not late when he actually manages to reach the office.</p>
          
          <p>Now he assumes here another thing, that he will have to ask for new information infinite number of
times. So, if he has k units of time in his hand at the starting of his journey, he needs to partition k in
infinite number of terms such that the infinite number of terms add up to k. He also notices that
each rejection square is decreasing in size and hence the time he requires to inspect each rejection
rectangle decreases as he moves nearer to his destination D, by the property of logarithmic spiral.</p>
          
          <p>So he approximates the partition of k into infinite number of terms by a geometric progression of
            infinite terms,</p>
          
          <p>Let he takes a (<k) units of time to cover the 1<sup>st</sup> rejection square and reach p<sub>1</sub><sup>0</sup>. Then he must cover
        the next rejection square in a.<MATH>{(k-a)<over>k}</MATH> units of time, the next rejection square in a.<MATH>{(k-a)<over>k}</MATH><sup>2</sup>
        units of time and so on,</p>
